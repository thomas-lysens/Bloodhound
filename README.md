This is a "proof of skill" project. The goal is to program a fully functioning packet sniffer / network analyser.
The conditions of this project are the following:
- Use the Rust Language
- Use Tokio for asynchronous programming
- Make it a CLI application
- Add documentation that explains parts of the program and how it works
- Make use of a single-crate project layout

Optional (when I feel like doing so):
- Create a GUI to interact with the program
- Make it integratable with a MCP server
- Improve the program by adding features to make the program stand out
